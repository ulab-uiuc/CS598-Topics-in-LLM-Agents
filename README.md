## Course Description
**Learning Objectives**: This course offers an in-depth exploration of the fascinating field of LLM agents. Designed as a seminar-style course, it guides students through the fundamental methods that power LLM agents and examines their practical applications in real-world contexts. At the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Have a great overview of state-of-the-art LLM agent papers;
- Familiar with the process of research process including paper submission, paper review and rebuttal;
- Critique and evaluate the design details of LLM agent papers.

**Structure**: The course is structured around reading cutting-edge research papers, student-led presentations, interactive discussions, and collaborative semester-long projects. We begin with an introduction to the core concepts of LLM agents, then delve into the latest research on building agents, covering topics including:  
- Agent ability
  - Reasoning
  -  Memory
  -  Planning
  -  Multimodal understanding
- Agent evaluation
- Agent framework
  - Tool use
  - Retrieval-augmented generation
  - Multi-agent systems
- Agent application
  - Auto-research
  - Code generation
  - Web agents
  - Gaming agents
- Challenges from agents to AGI
  - Data
  - Safety
  - Human-agent interaction
  - Alignment

## Tentative Schedule and Reading List
*Note: (1) This is an evolving list; (2) For each topic, there would be 2-3 "required" papers that presenter should include in their in-class presentation.*
